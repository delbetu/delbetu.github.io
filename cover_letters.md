Presentation Card
5 years working on RoR projects for clients in the US through local software factories.
Quality-oriented with proved experience.
Able to work remotely as a contractor, part-time or full-time.
Since I'm switching from local companies to direct with US client my salary expectation is below the average this time.

Elevator pitch:
I've spent the last 5 years working on RoR for US companies through local software factories.
I've been recognized as a great contributor dev by my teammates and manager.
I've contributed in many different ways to the project, such as:
* Helping others to ramp up
* Communicating complex things in a simple way
* Giving opinions to take better decisions as a team (design, architecting, planning)
* Help to spread the knowledge in many ways (slack, code reviews, documentation, pairing, meetings)
* Improving the existing code quality (refactoring code making it easier to understand and change in future)
* Creating spikes to investigate "how to implement ..."
* Delivering robust, test-driven designed, easy to change, object-oriented solutions.
And in many other ways...

I'm sure I'll be able to do the same in your organization.
