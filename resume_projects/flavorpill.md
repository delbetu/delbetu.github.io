Story

My first experience with rails, agile methodologies, git, english, ruby and testing.
Everything was challening to me at that point, every step required some previous investigation.
The team was pretty small only two people, I started in the project to replace a teammate who had 5 years of Rails experience so I felt under pressure because I didn't want to be unproductive but I had to learn to support that feeling because of the situation.
I would say that I was able to overcome all those problems just by supporting the pressure.
