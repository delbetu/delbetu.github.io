Description
Job Candidates Referrals for Tarmac.â€¨https://tarmac.referfriends.to/positions

This is an internal product from tarmac,
This product wants to help human resources on the hiring process.
The idea behind is that as an enterprise you pay your employees when they bring a friend to fit an open position.
This application facilitates that flow by connecting human resource with employees who refer friends. And allowing employees to spread the position in social networks.

Story
Helped building the minimum viable product, when I started working I realised that too many people had contributed before me. They seemed to focus on their small feature without looking at the big picture. So there was duplication and lack of concepts So I decided dedicate around 20% of time for each story to do some small refactor. While adding tests for everything not just the code I wrote for the story.
At the eyes of the product owner I was very unproductive but after a few months this had a huge impact on quality, no more errors on demos to the client, as developers our confidence in the system had increased.
We felt the system was more reliable.
Not afraid to modify old code because the test coverage let us know that we were breaking some other part of the system.
