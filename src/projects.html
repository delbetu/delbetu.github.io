            <h3> TODO App (BackboneJs + Rails)</h3>
            <p>
            This application is composed of two different projects backend and fronted.<br>
            Backend is a Rails 4 app which exposes a simple API to manage list of tasks.<br>
            Frontend is a backbone app which consumes the rails API.<br>
            This application was built with no previous knowledge of backbone-js. It was just to experiment new technologies.<br>
            </p>

            <h3> Task Logger (Ruby + Rspec)</h3>
            <p>
            Task logger is a simple console app for loggin your daily work.<br>
            It was developed using TDD, splitting code responsiblities into IO-interactor objects and UI program and Core functionality.<br>
            Core objects were tested first moking the interaction with collaborators.<br>
            That revealed the interface that IO objects should met.<br>
            This app interacts with external API as an IO device, and File storage as another IO device<br>
