### [Nothing is Something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPfEXIlTVE) [00:35:52] by **Sandi Metz** (2015)
How to program without using if?
Explica como utilizar el patron strategy para obtener
combinaciones de House con distintos formatos y distintos sort_algorithms
Que con herencia estamos limitados para obtener esto.
Para explicar utiliza la comparacion del metodo en diferentes branches.
Ahi se da cuenta de que lo que varia es el orden.
Entonces contruye 2 estrategias de ordenamiento, la que no hace nada DefaultOrder y la otra RandomOrder
La estrategia es identificar que es lo que se hace distinto en cada branch del condicional, darle 
un nombre y crear 2 objetos que tomen la responsabilidad de ese comportamiento.


### [Confident Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8J0j2xJFgQ) [00:31:24] by **Avdi Grimm** (2012)
Every method does:
1-Gather Input
2-Perform Work
3-Deliver Result
4-Handling Errors

-----------------------

1-Gather Input
  * Duck typing is treat the object as a duck, assumes that if is not it will complaint
  * The opposite of dick typing is switch statement smell
  * How can my method trust that input objects(or data) allways respond to the interface I need?

  If you find yourself doing these __over the input__:
    * Switch over a type of an object
    * Checking for method existence
    * Check for nil
  Then you can:
  __Coerce Input__
    * __validate type preconditions__ by calling `.to_s`, `.to_i`, `Array()` on the types that you expect.

__Decorate Input__
    * Enclose the switch over the object and introduce special case object,
       making sure that for all cases conforms to the same interface

__Reject invalid Input__
  * If you cannot wrap the input with a switch for special cases, then validate preconditions.
  * ( raise error | return do-nothing) if precondition not met

__Do nothing with NullObject__
  * return a NullObject which means do-nothing
  * The NullObject returns self for all method calls
  * A useful constructor for NullObject is Maybe() method

__Use default values__
  * Another way of handling nil cases is defining a defalut value

2-Perform Work
* JQuery Style
* Chaining over an arryfied result
* This avoid error handling by doing-nothing when some step in the chain returns empty

3-Deliver Result
* Don't return nil
* Return special-case or null-object
* Or raise an error

4-Handling Errors
* Isolate error handling with a bouncer method(raise error or do-nothing)
* Use checked_xxxx methods where xxxx represents a side-effect that can raise errors
