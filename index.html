I've also made valuable contributions beyond coding, I've given technical presentations, helped hire talented folks in Uruguay, motivated team members to collaborate, and explored new tech to enhance our projects.<br />
I'm always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies

Outside of work, I'm a proud dad of three amazing kids.
